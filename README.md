PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
LinkedIn Clone is a full-stack professional networking and job portal web application that replicates 
core LinkedIn functionalities. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React-like vanilla 
JavaScript, Node.js), this platform enables professionals to connect, share content, and explore 
career opportunities while allowing employers to post jobs and manage recruitment processes. 
The application features a dual-user system (Employees and Employers) with distinct dashboards and 
capabilities. Employees can build professional profiles, network with peers, browse and apply for 
jobs, share posts, and communicate via direct messaging. Employers can post job listings, review 
applications, manage candidates, and analyze recruitment metrics through an integrated analytics 
dashboard. 
With a modern beige-themed UI design, real-time messaging system, social feed with engagement 
features (likes, comments, shares), and comprehensive job management tools, this clone 
demonstrates proficiency in building scalable web applications with authentication, database design, 
RESTful APIs, and responsive user interfaces. The platform showcases practical implementation of 
professional networking features including connection management, profile views tracking, skill
based search, and application status workflows.
